# Tech Stack, what are they, and what are the differences 

> A tech stack is the set of technologies used to develop an application, including programming languages, frameworks, databases, front-end and back-end tools, and APIs.
- chosen based on your application, your preference, popularity

## 3 parts 
1. Frontend
2. APIs
3. Backend

### [Frontend](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/front-end-development/)
> tools required to build a user interface. development of the user side. (washing machine buttons, what user can see and set)

The real confusions, types of tools available:

***Language***
- HTML
- CSS
- JS


***Framworks/Libraries***
> Which are structures/set of predefined functions that provide a base for the application development process. It provides a set of tools and elements that help in the speedy development process. It acts like a template that can be used and even modified to meet the project requirements. This prevents developers having to write everything from scartch
- React
- Angular
- Vue
- jQuery
- Bootstrap (css)
- TailwindCSS
- Material UI

### [Backend](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backend-development/)
> server-side of the website: including tools such as database to store data, cloud providers to purchase such infrastructure from, and various APIs. (washing machine internal tools to spin the clothes, mix the detergent, which doesn't need user's intervention)

types of tools:

***languages/frameworks***
- PHP/Laravel
- JS/NodeJS
- JS(NodeJS)/Express 
- Python/Django
- Python/Flask
- Spring Boot/Java
- Ruby/Ruby on Rails

***containerisation***
> process of packaging software code with all the necessary elements like frameworks, libraries, and other dependencies, to make services isolated from each other in a container
- docker
- Kubernetes

***[Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-tools/)***

***module bundler***

### APIs
> tools that connect the frontend to the backend (falls within both frontend and backend)

### Then what is git?
