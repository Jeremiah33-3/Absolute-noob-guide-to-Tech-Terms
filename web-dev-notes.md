## Exports

Named exports versus default exports, link [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46913851/why-and-when-to-use-default-export-over-named-exports-in-es6-modules)
- a file can have multiple named exports but can have only 1 default export
- developers give default exports names when they import it, while we must use the names of named exports
- need to use curly braces for named exports

## React hooks
- it is a function that is returning something (e.g. useState() returns an array with two values representing current state and the state setter function)
